<b><u>Korean Food</b></u><Br>
<p><b>Korean Army Stew</b><Br>
<Li>Instant noodles, tteok, American cheese, sausages, Spam, and various veggies make up this jumbled stew that goes back to the immediate aftermath of the Korean War.</Li>
<Li>Since meat was in short supply, chefs came up with inventive ways to replace it using the excess food from the American army installation stationed in Seoul, thus the stew's name.</Li>
<Li>A buddae jjigae without Spam is unthinkable, despite the fact that meat has now become widely available.</Li>
</p>
<p><b>Tteokbokki</b><Br>
<Li>The famous red-orange rice cakes (tteokbokki), which are steamed and cut into slices and served with fish cakes (oden) and scallions in a sweet and spicy sauce made of chili paste, are so well-liked that a entire part of Seoul is dedicated to them.</Li>
<Li>The sauce has been reported to contain a variety of ingredients, including ketchup and black soybean paste. The more pepper the better. Tteokbokki can be found in Korean army stews as well.</Li>
</p>
<p><b>Kimchi</b><Br>
<Li>Last but definitely not least, kimchi. Although the ingredients of kimchi might vary, they often consist of a mixture of veggies, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, salt, and fish sauce. Originally, the mixture was pickled and fermented as a means to store the veggies for the winter. The most popular vegetable used to create kimchi is cabbage, although other typical ingredients include carrots, radish, cucumber, and scallions. It's quite simple to turn kimchi into a vegan dish by using only plant-based components. There are hundreds of kimchi recipes that differ depending on the place and season in which they are made. Kimchi is the most common dish served and seen in restaurants and homes.</Li>
